# barrel-patch_analysis
Code I contributed for Sofia's project containing NMF patch analysis, some simulations etc.

NOTE (5th January 2023): this repo currently ISN'T runnable, since it assumes dependencies on the devenw library (not included within). I will refactor this code in the following weeks so it will be easy to use for everyone.
